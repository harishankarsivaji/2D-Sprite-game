# 2D Sprite Based Game 

GLUT is an API (application Programming Interface) that provides a platform-independent interface to window management, keyboard and mouse input. OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a cross-language, multi-platform application programming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics.  OpenGL supports no file formats so you need to create code or use external libraries to load content (images and models) into memory. For a number of reasons many prefer to use freeGLUT rather than GLUT, which is what we will do here.
